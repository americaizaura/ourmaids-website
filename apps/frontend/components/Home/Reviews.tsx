She asked where I had left the vacuum cleaner and cleaning supplies, and two hours later my apartment was nice and clean. I can recommend her more highly. Her agency, Our Maids Franchise, Inc., also provides her with excellent support.",

I highly recommend her for any cleaning job, no matter how large or small. We were pleasantly surprised by how well this company handled our transaction; we will definitely do business with them again in the future.",
